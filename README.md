# NYC-Airbnb-Data-Analysis
Google Sheetsâ€“based analysis of Airbnb listings in NYC, highlighting pricing trends, neighborhood insights, and booking patterns.
# Introduction:
This project analyzes Airbnb listing data in New York City using Google Sheets to uncover trends in pricing, availability, and neighborhood performance.
After cleaning the dataset, I performed exploratory analysis using pivot tables and charts to evaluate price variations across boroughs, identify top-performing neighborhoods, and detect potential oversupply in certain areas.
